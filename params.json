{"name":"Collaboratool","tagline":"Virtualized container for portable, reproducible data science","body":"### Welcome to the Collaboratool Project\r\n\r\nCollaboratool is an umbrella project for the creation of reproducible, reliable scientific computing environments. What problems does this do for you?\r\n\r\n1. No more obscure installation issues - download and run a single virtual machine or just visit a server via a web browser.\r\n2. I'm teaching a class - when you tell a student that a program behaves a certain way, it does!\r\n3. I'm collaborating on some scientific research - now all of your collaborators can run your code without complex installation instructions.\r\n\r\n### Who are we?\r\n\r\nCollaboratool is a project that started in the [D-Lab](http://dlab.berkeley.edu), with collaboration from [EECS](http://www.eecs.berkeley.edu). We're working with the [Statistical Computing Facility](http://http://statistics.berkeley.edu/computing) to have learning environments ready to go for the spring semester.","google":"UA-41111933-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
